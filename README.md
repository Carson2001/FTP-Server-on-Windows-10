# System Administration Labs

Welcome to my System Administration Labs repository. This repository is a collection of my work setting up and managing various system administration tasks. It includes labs for configuring peer-to-peer FTP servers, Active Directory setups, and the implementation of Group Policies and security policies within virtualized environments using VirtualBox and Windows Hyper-V.

## Disclaimer

## Overview

The goal of these labs is to provide a hands-on approach to learning system administration tasks. These configurations simulate real-world scenarios that help in understanding the core responsibilities of a system administrator, including network security, user management, and service deployment.

## Labs Included

- **Active Directory (AD) Setup:** Complete AD installations including user and group management.
- **Group Policy Objects (GPOs):** Deployment of GPOs to manage settings across a network of virtual machines.
- **Security Policies:** Implementation of various security policies to ensure network security and compliance.
- **FTP Server Configuration:** Setup of peer-to-peer FTP servers for file sharing and management.

## Getting Started

To utilize these labs, you will need to install VirtualBox and Windows Hyper-V. Here are the steps to prepare your environment:

1. Download and install [Oracle VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Windows Hyper-V](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v).
3. Set up virtual machines as described in each lab's documentation.

## Usage

Each lab is organized into its own directory within the repository. Inside each directory, you will find all necessary files along with detailed documentation explaining the lab's purpose, setup instructions, and configuration details.
